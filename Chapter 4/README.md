# Chapter 4: Classification

## Overview
Welcome to the Chapter 4 exercises from the International Statistical Literacy Project (ISLP) book! This repository contains exercises designed to help you reinforce and apply the statistical concepts discussed in Chapter 4 of the ISLP book.

## Exercise Description
In this repository, you will find exercises covering key topics from Chapter 4, including:

- Binary classification
- Multiclass classification
- Evaluation metrics for classification models
- Feature selection and preprocessing for classification
- Model training and evaluation for classification tasks
- And more!

Each exercise is crafted to provide hands-on practice and enhance your understanding of classification techniques and related concepts in statistical modeling.

## Getting Started
To get started with the exercises:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the Chapter 4 exercise folder.
3. Open the exercise files in your preferred statistical analysis software or programming environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the exercise file to complete the tasks and exercises.

## Exercise Structure
The Chapter 4 exercise folder contains:

- A README.md file providing an overview of the exercises and instructions.
